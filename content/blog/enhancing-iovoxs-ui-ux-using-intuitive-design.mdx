## The Challenge

IOVOX provides advanced call tracking and analytics solutions but faced usability challenges that hindered user adoption. Their platform required a **modern, intuitive design** that enhanced accessibility while maintaining their robust feature set.

## Our Approach

We conducted a **deep UI/UX audit**, identifying key pain points in navigation, dashboard structure, and overall user flow. Our design team then developed a **clean, intuitive interface** with improved information hierarchy, interactive dashboards, and a seamless mobile experience.
