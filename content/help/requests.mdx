- ## How do I submit a request?  

  Once you subscribe, you’ll get access to our dashboard. Simply create a card with the details of your project, and we’ll start working on it based on your plan’s priority level.  

- ## What happens after I submit a request?  

  Our team reviews your request and starts working on it based on your plan. You’ll receive progress updates, and once the first draft is ready, you can provide feedback for revisions if needed.  

- ## How long does it take to complete a request?  

  Turnaround time depends on the complexity of the request. Most requests take 1-3 business days, while more complex tasks like website development or branding may take longer.  

- ## Can I change my request after submission?  

  Minor adjustments can be made, but major changes may require submitting a new request. If you're unsure about changes, reach out to us as soon as possible.
