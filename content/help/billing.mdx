- ## How does billing work?  

  Subscriptions are billed automatically each month. You’ll receive an invoice via email, and you can also manage payments through your dashboard.  

- ## Do you offer refunds?  

  We don’t offer refunds since our service is on-demand. However, if you’re unsatisfied, reach out to us, and we’ll do our best to resolve the issue.  

- ## Can I change my payment method?  

  Yes, you can update your payment details anytime. Contact support for detailed instructions.  

- ## What happens if my payment fails?  

  If a payment fails, you’ll receive a notification. You’ll have a few days to update your payment method before your account is paused.
