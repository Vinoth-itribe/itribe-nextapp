- ## What counts as a request?

  A request or a task is any to-do you assign us. It can be to design a logo, do revisions to an existing design, do website maintenance, or anything else. A request is anything that requires someone from our team to work on any of your projects.

- ## How do the different subscription plans work?  

  Our plans allow you to submit creative requests based on your needs. Each plan comes with different levels of priority and the number of active requests you can have at a time. Simply submit a request through the dashboard, and our team will start working on it.  

- ## How many requests can I submit at a time?  

  We offer unlimited requests. We will start working on your requests one at a time based on priority. If you need multiple requests handled simultaneously, you can upgrade your plan or purchase an add-on.  

- ## What kind of services can I request?  

  You can request services like website design, branding, social media ads, video editing, and more. If you’re unsure whether a request falls within our scope, feel free to ask before submitting.  

- ## Is there a limit to revisions on a request?  

  No, we offer unlimited revisions to ensure you’re satisfied. However, if a request significantly changes from the original brief, it may be treated as a new request.
