- ## How can I switch my subscription plan?  

  You can upgrade or downgrade your plan anytime. Simply contact our support. If you upgrade, the change takes effect immediately. Downgrades take effect at the end of your billing cycle.  

- ## Can I pause my subscription?  

  Yes, you can pause your subscription for up to 3 months. While paused, you won’t be able to submit new requests, but your queued requests will be saved for when you resume.  

- ## What happens if I cancel my plan?  

  If you cancel, you’ll retain access until the end of your billing cycle. After that, you won’t be able to submit new requests, but you can still download past work.  

- ## Will I lose my requests if I change plans?  

  No, your existing requests remain in your queue. If you downgrade to a plan with fewer active requests, the additional ones will be put on hold until a slot becomes available.
